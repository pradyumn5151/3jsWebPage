# Website Structure

There is a fictional world of a desktop game somewhere. 
In this world, humanity has already evolved, exploded throughout
the solar system, seen a golden age of galatic expansion and 
civilization, and much of it has died since.

You are one of the last remaining embers of humanity, part of 
Project Helidon. Project Helidon was a major undertaking of the
Galactic Republic Government. They transported 7 scientists
to 7 different remote potentially habitable planets to cradle 
humanity in case of galactic extinction.

This website is the showcase of Helidon Orbiting Station v7.3,
which is a small space station in which the protagonist of the 
game resides. All 7 scientists are present in their own 
Oribiting Stations in 7 unique remote places in the galaxy.
