# Website Structure

There is a fictional world of a desktop game somewhere. 
In this world, humanity has already evolved, exploded throughout
the solar system, seen a golden age of galatic expansion and 
civilization, and much of it has died since.

You are one of the last remaining embers of humanity, part of 
Project Helidon. Project Helidon was a major undertaking of the
Galactic Republic Government. They transported 7 scientists
to 7 different remote potentially habitable planets to cradle 
humanity in case of galactic extinction.

This website is the showcase of Helidon Orbiting Station v7.3,
which is a small space station in which the protagonist of the 
game resides. All 7 scientists are present in their own 
Oribiting Stations in 7 unique remote places in the galaxy.

    Intro of the Helidon Orbiting Station v7.3

    The Helidon Orbiting Station v7.3 was developed from the initial 
    Helidon Project Standard after numerous hours of human effort and
    testing. It is believed to be a marvel of the greatest depth.
    It is designed to provide life support for over a 10 million human 
    average life hours, enough for around 130 people to live their entire 
    life spans. Latest standards of Helidon energy generation, 
    energy storage, life sciences lab, access to Helidon Omnipresent Human 
    Knowledge Log, along with 12 cryo sleep chambers will enhance the quality 
    of life and the quality of the Helidon Mission for far longer than planned.

    Version 7.3 was specifically designed for operation in following deep space and 
    beyond physically accessible parts of the universe:
    
    1. Deep Space Orbit around the Galactic Center of Milky Way
    2. Deep Space Orbit around Planet A124X_03, the 4th planet from the Veda Star
    3. Deep Space Aster Centric Orbit the binary star system of the Ahamkara and Ravana Stars
    4. The 3rd Lagrange Point of the "Deadly Whimpering Orange" Neutron Star
    5. Low Geocentric Orbit around Europa, a moon of Jupiter in the Cradle Solar System
    6. Low Gamma Examination Orbit around Gargantua, a small black hole passing through the Milky Way
    7. Open Trajectory into Inter Galactic Space, projecting away from Milky Way into Andromeda Galaxy

    Features: 

        Solar Panels
            With the latest Helidon Energy Generation Standards, Solar Panels provided can generate 
            electrical energy from absorbing photons, neutrons and neutrinos in deep space.
            The panel sizes and efficiency vary depending on local environments and interstellar wind 
            attributes. For reference, in low Earth orbit, the panels have a maximum efficiency of 120 KW.
